Frustrating Tetris
==================

An HTML5 Frustrating Tetris Game

Forked from https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris

Added feature: there is a probability that the current brick
is dropped regardless of what the user action was. This
probability increases as the pit gets filled up, so that
the game is more likely to ignore your action when the game
is at a critical stage.
